Awesome! Let's break this down with some guided questions to help you shape the project and give it real purpose ‚Äî while making sure it's something you can *learn a lot from*.

---

### üß≠ 1. **What's the tool's main purpose?**
- Is it just a launcher (like a dashboard for tools)?
- Do you want it to **orchestrate tools** (e.g., run tools in sequence or automatically based on input)?
- Should it help manage **output/results** from tools?
- Do you imagine a **GUI, TUI (terminal UI), or just CLI**?

---

### üß∞ 2. **What kinds of hacking tools do you want to integrate?**
- Local tools (e.g., `nmap`, `netexec`, `metasploit`, `sqlmap`)?
- Remote/cloud-based tools?
- Are these all CLI tools or do any have APIs/interactive interfaces?

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **What kind of features would you like to build into it?**
Here are some ideas to inspire you ‚Äî which ones sound fun?

- Tool auto-discovery (find tools in `$PATH` or a given folder)
- Saved tool profiles (e.g., predefined `nmap` scan presets)
- Chained execution (e.g., run `nmap`, parse IPs, feed them to `netexec`)
- Output parsing and pretty display (turn CLI mess into readable info)
- Credential vault / wordlist manager
- Port/service detection and smart tool suggestion
- Plugin system for future expansion
- Project/workspace management (store tool outputs per target)
- SSH / WinRM / RDP launcher?

---

### üß† 4. **What do you want to learn the most through this?**
This will help guide how ambitious we make it.

- OS-level process control? (`subprocess`, IPC, etc.)
- Building CLIs or TUIs?
- Networking and sockets?
- Parsing and transforming output (JSON, XML, raw text)?
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Windows/Mac)?
- Packaging and distribution (like making `.deb`, `.pkg`, etc.)?

---

### üß™ 5. **What‚Äôs your current experience level?**
Just so I can better tailor the suggestions:
- Are you familiar with Python scripting already?
- Have you used any of the tools you'd want to launch?
- Any experience with threading/concurrency or networking?

---

Once we go through these, I can help you:
- Choose a solid architecture
- Pick the right starting point
- Plan some beginner ‚Üí advanced features for learning curve
- Decide which language might suit best based on your answers
