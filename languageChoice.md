That's a great learning project idea! Building a tool to launch and manage hacking-related software (like a launcher or orchestrator) can definitely teach you a lot â€” not just programming, but also OS-level operations, process handling, scripting, etc.

Since your **goal is to learn something useful** (even if it's harder at first), here's a breakdown of solid language options depending on what *you* want to explore most:

---

## ðŸ¥‡ **Python** â€“ The Classic Choice (but still very powerful)
- **Pros**:
  - Widely used in the hacking and infosec community (think: *Impacket, NetExec, Evil-WinRM, pwntools*).
  - Tons of libraries to automate, control processes, do networking, etc.
  - Great for scripting tools and managing subprocesses.
  - Easy to integrate with existing hacking tools (often written in Python or have CLI interfaces).
- **Cons**:
  - You might outgrow it if you want to dig deep into OS internals or performance-heavy tasks.

âœ… *Verdict*: Perfect if you're just getting into tooling and want to start building right away. Also highly employable.

## ðŸ¥ˆ **Rust** â€“ The Challenger (for serious learners)
- **Pros**:
  - Extremely fast, memory safe, and modern.
  - Becoming more and more popular in security (e.g., [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)).
  - Forces you to learn *how* things work (ownership, memory, etc.).
- **Cons**:
  - Steep learning curve.
  - Slower development pace vs. scripting languages.

âœ… *Verdict*: Great if you want to learn **low-level systems programming** and develop **rock-solid, modern tools**. Excellent investment long-term.

## ðŸ¥‰ **Go (Golang)** â€“ The Middle Ground
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to learn compared to Rust, but compiles to fast, static binaries.
  - Great for building network tools (used in projects like [hush](https://github.com/denandz/hush), [amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass)).
  - Built-in concurrency model makes it fun for networking and tool orchestration.
- **Cons**:
  - Less deep than Rust; more rigid than Python.

âœ… *Verdict*: A practical language to learn if you're into **network-based tools**, portability, and want more speed/control than Python without the complexity of Rust.

## ðŸ§  Decision Flow:
> Choose based on your learning goals:

| Goal | Best Language |
|------|----------------|
| Start fast, automate tools, learn scripting | **Python** |
| Build robust, low-level, efficient tools | **Rust** |
| Develop fast CLI/network tools with easy concurrency | **Go** |

---

If you're curious:  
I'd recommend **starting with Python** to build your MVP launcher (and learn subprocess handling, argument parsing, networking, etc.) â€” then **try re-writing parts of it in Rust or Go** once you understand the concepts. Thatâ€™s a killer combo for learning.
